## The drosophila system
It's not like I love flies. They are just convenient.

Climate change is terrifying for all living beings. Insects are ectoterms and play countless roles in biological networks. Maybe it is a good idea to try to understand what is going to happen to them?

## Insect-microorganisms interactions
I like symbionts. And I like commensals. And I like pathogens too.
